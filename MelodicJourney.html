			<b>Hey everyone, it's SarovKun here</b>, and I want to share a bit about my musical journey with you all. So, picture this: I was born in Nepal, surrounded by beautiful mountains and a rich culture. But when I was 13, my family moved to Goa, India. It was a big change, but it opened up a whole new world for me, especially when it came to music.
		</p>
		<p>
			Back when I was in 10th grade, I picked up a guitar. It was just something to do at first, but then it became a passion. I started strumming away, learning chords and melodies. And you know what? I wasn't half bad! That's when I realized music was more than just a hobby for me – it was a way to express myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			But it didn't stop there. I wanted to push myself even further. So, I started singing too. Let me tell you, it was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but practice makes perfect, right? Slowly but surely, I found my voice, and I haven't stopped singing since.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then came the digital age, and with it, the world of music production. I got my hands on a digital audio workstation (DAW), and let me tell you, it was a game-changer. Suddenly, I could create beats, mix tracks, and bring my musical ideas to life like never before. It was like having a whole studio right at my fingertips.
		</p>
                <p>
			When I turned 17, I took a leap of faith and released my first single. Was it perfect? Nah, far from it. But you know what it was? A start. It gave me the confidence to keep going, to keep honing my craft and chasing my dreams.
		</p>
                <p>
			Nowadays, I'm knee-deep in college assignments, but you better believe I still find time for music. In fact, I'm working on all sorts of projects – not just for myself, but for other talented folks too. I figure, why not spread the love, right? Plus, it's a great way to sharpen my skills and learn new things along the way.
		</p>
                <p>
			So yeah, that's my musical journey in a nutshell. It hasn't always been easy, but it's definitely been worth it. Music has a way of bringing people together, and I'm grateful every day to be a part of that. Who knows where this journey will take me next, but one thing's for sure – I'll always have my guitar and my voice to guide me along the way.
